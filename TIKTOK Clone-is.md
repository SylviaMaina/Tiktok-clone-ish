# Tiktok-clone-ish
This is a tiktok landing page.
I decided to make this page to strengthen my css skills. This project helped me position the icons in different areas of the page.
The icons were downloaded from material.io

Below is an image of how the project turned out.

There are improvements that still need to be made like making the page fully responsive but im proud of the outcome so far.
